 * Light weight actors for Java. Concurrency is controlled by a parallel Strategy.

 * Given some effect, the Actor performs the effect on its messages using its Strategy, transforming them
 * into instances of fj.P1. The P1 represents a possibly running computation which is executing the effect.
 * <p/>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> A value of this type may generally process more than one message at a time, depending on its Strategy.
 * An actor is not thread-safe unless either its Effect imposes an order on incoming messages or its Strategy is
 * single-threaded.
 *
 * A queue actor which imposes an order on its messages is provided by the {@link #queueActor} static method.
