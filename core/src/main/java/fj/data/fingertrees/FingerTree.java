/**
 * Provides 2-3 finger trees, a functional representation of persistent sequences supporting access to the ends in
 * amortized O(1) time. Concatenation and splitting time is O(log n) in the size of the smaller piece.
 * A general purpose data structure that can serve as a sequence, priority queue, search tree, priority search queue
 * and more.
 * <p/>
 * This class serves as a datastructure construction kit, rather than a datastructure in its own right. By supplying
 * a monoid, a measurement function, insertion, deletion, and so forth, any purely functional datastructure can be
 * emulated. See {@link Seq} for an example.
 * <p/>
 * Based on "Finger trees: a simple general-purpose data structure", by Ralf Hinze and Ross Paterson.
 *
 * @param <V> The monoidal type with which to annotate nodes.
 * @param <A> The type of the tree's elements.
